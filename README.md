# Face-detection-opencv
*Face detection is a computer technology being used in a variety of applications that identifies human faces in digital images. 
*With face detection, you can get the information you need to perform tasks like embellishing selfies and portraits, or generating avatars from a user's photo. Because ML Kit can perform face detection in real time, you can use it in applications like video chat or games that respond to the player's expressions
Algorithm:<br />
1)Loading haarCascadeFacealgorith<br />
2)Initializing camera<br />
3)Reading from camera<br />
4)Converting color image in to grayscale image.<br/>
5)obtaining face coordinates by passing algorithm(detectMultiscale)<br/>
6)Drawing rectangle on the face co- ordinates<br />
7)Display the output frame.
